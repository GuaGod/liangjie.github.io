I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student at Peking University, under the supervision of Prof. Ronggang Wang. I received my B.Eng. degree from the School of Computer Science and Technology at Harbin Institute of Technology.

My current research interests lie in 3D computer vision, with a focus on dynamic scene reconstruction and human-centric tasks such as digital avatar creation, leveraging techniques like 3D Gaussian Splatting.
