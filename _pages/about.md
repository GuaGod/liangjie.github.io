I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), under the supervision of Prof. [Ronggang Wang](https://www.ece.pku.edu.cn/info/1073/2562.htm). I received my B.Eng. degree from the School of Computer Science and Technology at [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://www.hit.edu.cn/).

My current research interests lie in 3D computer vision, with a focus on dynamic scene reconstruction and human-centric tasks such as digital avatar creation, leveraging techniques like 3D Gaussian Splatting.
