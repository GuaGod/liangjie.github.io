I am currently a forth-year Ph.D. student at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), under the supervision of Prof. [Ronggang Wang](https://www.ece.pku.edu.cn/info/1073/2562.htm). I received my B.Eng. degree from the School of Computer Science and Technology at [Northeast Normal University](https://www.nenu.edu.cn/).

My current research interests lie in 3D computer vision, with a focus on dynamic scene reconstruction and Multi View Stereo, leveraging techniques like 3D Gaussian Splatting and COLMAP.
